**How to use?**

Download the latest release of it and put it in any folder on your pc (prefferably an empty one).

Then just start it up and it will create a _music_ folder there you can put all your .wav(more types will be supported soon) files and they will be automatically
added when you start up the program.

Then you can just type the index of the music file as it shows in the program and it will play the music for you.

**Want to use Early Versions?**

You are gonna have to compile it yourself then, or you are just gonna have to wait for pre releases.

**Plans**

Add support for .mp3, .ogg, etc.
