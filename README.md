**How to use?**

Download the latest release of it and put it in any folder on your pc (prefferably an empty one).

Then just start it up and it will create a _music_ folder there you can put all your .wav(more types will be supported soon) files and they will be automatically
added when you start up the program.

**Plans**

Add support for .mp3, .ogg, etc.
